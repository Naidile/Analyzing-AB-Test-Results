# Analyzing A/B Test Results
Concepts of probability, A/B Testing and regression are used to
understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company 
understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, 
or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
